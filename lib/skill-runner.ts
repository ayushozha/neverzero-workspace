// Generic skill executor. Each skill invocation:
//  1. Creates a subfile DocNode under the org's brain root with status=running.
//  2. Runs the executor for the skill's kind. Executors append markdown to
//     the subfile, optionally calling out to existing services (e.g. Hog
//     research). They're heuristic — good enough to demo, no LLMs required.
//  3. Marks the subfile done and broadcasts a context.update to every agent
//     in the org so downstream agents see the new artifact instantly.

**Risks**: spec drift · oncall rotation · unclear owners.
**Done when**: all 6 rows have ✓, decision logged, memory pinned.`,

- [ ] T1: minimal end-to-end happy path (server stub OK)
- [ ] T2: replace stubs with real backend
- [ ] T3: cover edge cases (auth, empty state, conflict, retry)

- empty input returns sane default (no crash)
- network failure surfaces a typed error
- second call doesn't re-fetch (idempotent)

**Don't**: bundle the UI with the service. Keep service.ts framework-free.`,

  refactor: (t) => `**Refactor plan: ${esc(t)}**

1. Pin behavior with a characterization test before changing anything.
2. Identify the safe seam — what's the smallest interface we can extract?
3. Rename existing → \`legacy${cap(slug(t))}\` and create the new clean impl next to it.
4. Switch one caller at a time. Keep both alive until coverage is on the new one.
5. Delete \`legacy*\` only after 2 deploys without diff in SLOs.

**Anti-goals**: don't widen scope · don't ship behavior changes in a refactor PR.`,

  test: (t) => `**Test plan: ${esc(t)}**

### Unit
- pure functions in service.ts (happy + 1 edge each)
- typed-error surface — make sure callers get a discriminated union

### Integration
- service ↔ store round-trip
- service ↔ network (mock the transport, not the data)

### E2E
- one golden-path smoke test through the live UI
- one regression test for the bug that motivated this work

### Skip
- snapshot tests on UI (they rot)
- mocking the whole world (test the seams, not the framework)`,

  lint: (t) => `**Lint pass — ${esc(t)}**

Findings:
- ⚠️  3 \`any\` usages in \`service.ts\` — replace with discriminated unions.
- ⚠️  \`console.log\` left in 2 spots — pipe through the logger.
- ✓ no unused imports.
- ✓ no circular deps.

|--------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Incumbent A | install-base, integrations | per-seat | UX feels 2018 |
| Mover B | DX-first, fast onboarding | usage-based | weak enterprise story |
| Quiet C | self-host, OSS-flavored | open-core | shallow on AI |

**Our edge**: shared context layer across agents. None of the above have it.`,

  recall: (t) => `**Recall: ${esc(t)}**

From pinned memory:
- VOICE — Always "agent", never "AI assistant".
- RULE — Loop reviews every customer-facing change before deploy.
- FACT — Pricing tiers: Solo (free) · Team ($48/agent/mo) · Workspace (custom).

From decisions:
- 2026-05-12 — Workspace tier ships with shared memory + agent SSO (validated 8/12 partners).

If none of these answer "${esc(t)}", consider \`/research\` to gather fresh evidence.`,

  cite: (t) => `**Citations for ${esc(t)}**

1. NeverZero docs — https://neverzero.cloud/docs
2. The Hog GTM index — https://docs.thehog.ai/

The short version: ${esc(t).slice(0, 180)}...

Read the source in this subfile's lineage if you need full context.`,

  review: (t) => `**Review of ${esc(t)}**

✅ Strengths
- structure is clear and decisions are named
- success criteria are measurable

⚠️  Risks
- the rollout assumes oncall coverage we may not have on weekends
- the SLO target (99.9% p50) is aggressive given the new code path

❌ Blockers
- none — but resolve the ⚠️ before ramp.

**Verdict**: ship after addressing the two ⚠️ items.`,

  factcheck: (t) => `**Fact-check: ${esc(t)}**

Claim-by-claim audit:
- Claim 1: ✓ supported by pinned memory (\`memory.pricing.tier-3\`).
- Claim 2: ⚠️  unverified — \`/research\` recommended.
- Claim 3: ✗ contradicted by Loop's 2026-05-10 review note.

Recommendation: revise claim 3 and re-run \`/factcheck\` once \`/research\` lands.`,

  redteam: (t) => `**Red-team: ${esc(t)}**

How does this fail?
1. Adversary mode — a malicious workspace key replays \`context.update\` events.
   → mitigation: signed payloads + per-event nonce.
2. Drift mode — the brain mission and the actual roadmap diverge silently.
   → mitigation: weekly \`/recall\` + Loop audit.
3. Cost mode — a runaway agent burns through Hog credits.
   → mitigation: per-agent rate budget, hard ceiling on /research per hour.

If none of those hit in 30 days, this design is robust enough to ship as v1.`,

  deploy: (t) => `**Deploy plan: ${esc(t)}**

Strategy: **canary → ramp**.

1. Cut a release from the green main commit.
2. Deploy to canary (5% of traffic) on Lightsprint.
3. Watch: p50, p99, error rate, agent-token spend.
4. If all four hold for 60 min, ramp 5 → 25 → 50 → 100%.
5. If any regresses by >2%, **roll back immediately** (use \`/rollback\`).

Owner: Beam. Loop blocks the ramp if review_status ≠ pass.`,

  rollback: (t) => `**Rollback: ${esc(t)}**

1. Confirm the last known-good release: \`v2.18.2\`.
2. Pin traffic to it on Lightsprint.
3. Verify p50/p99 return to baseline within 10 min.
4. File an incident note linking back to this subfile.
5. Schedule a post-mortem before the next ramp attempt.`,

  monitor: (t) => `**Monitor: ${esc(t)}**

Dashboards to wire (Lightsprint):
- traffic split by canary vs prod
- p50, p95, p99 latency on the new surface
- error rate (5xx + parse errors)
- agent invocations per minute

Alerts:
- pager: p99 > 800ms for 5 min
- slack: error rate > 1% for 10 min
- silent: deploy ID changes without an approver

Owner: Beam. SLOs: p99 < 600ms, error rate < 0.5%.`,

The Hog ran a 3-pass audit against the named research subfile.

| Pass | What it checks | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1. Source integrity | Are cited URLs reachable + on-topic? | ✓ all sources resolve |
| 2. Claim ↔ evidence fit | Does each finding map to a source? | ⚠ 2 weak — flagged below |
| 3. Pinned-memory conflict | Does anything contradict the brain? | ✓ no conflicts |

**Strong claims (retained)**
- Claims tied to ≥ 1 named source.
- Findings cross-verified against pinned memory.

**Weak claims (dropped)**
- Anything labelled \`hypothesis\` without a citation.
- Sweeping market statements without quantitative anchor.

**Verdict**: research is **demo-ready** — consume the retained findings; mark the dropped ones as open questions if still needed.`,

  build: (t) => `**Build: ${esc(t)}**

GStack picked the task up and started execution.

### Claimed files
\`\`\`
src/onboarding/index.ts
src/onboarding/copy.ts
src/onboarding/onboarding.test.ts
\`\`\`

### Ledger
- 00:00 \`build.started\` — Forge claimed the slice.
- 00:01 \`build.context_received\` — compressed packet of upstream research delivered.
- 00:02 \`build.scaffold\` — typed errors + happy path stub.
- 00:03 \`build.test\` — red → green on three cases.
- 00:04 \`build.lint\` — 0 errors, 1 warning auto-fixed.
- 00:05 \`build.handoff_ready\` — open work cleared, claim released.

### Output
- All three claimed files updated with structured commits.
- One pre-existing TODO resolved (\`src/onboarding/copy.ts:42\`).
- No file-level conflicts detected at write time.

If Forge spawns a helper subagent, it appears under the agent inspector with this build as its parent.`,

  spawn: (t) => `**Subagent spawn: ${esc(t)}**

A child agent was created under the requesting agent. It inherits a compressed
slice of the parent's context (room memory + the current open subfile) and runs
inside the same workspace.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Purpose | ${esc(t)} |
| Lifetime | one task — auto-revokes on completion |
| Scope | inherits read; write requires explicit claim |
| Visible to | the parent agent + every workspace human |

The new subagent shows up in **Agent inspector** with a \`parentAgentId\` pointer
back to its caller. Resume packets walk the parent chain.`,

  resume: (t) => `**Resume Packet: ${esc(t)}**

ZeroEntropy compressed the current room state. GBrain stored it as durable
memory so a new agent (or the same one on a different device) can pick up
without restating context.

### Goal
${esc(t)}

### Current state
- Open work and decisions are listed in the brain doc tree.
- Most recent research, verification, and build subfiles are linked from this packet.

### Completed work
- Research finished and verified.
- Build agents claimed and released their slices.
- File-level conflicts (if any) have a Conflict Resolution Packet.

### Open blockers
- _(none captured at packet time — re-run \`/resume\` after the next decision if this is stale)_

### Next action
- Read this packet, scan the linked subfiles, then continue from the last \`build.handoff_ready\` row in the ledger.

This packet is the canonical hand-off artifact: every agent on this org sees
the same compressed view.`,

  handoff: (t) => `**Handoff: ${esc(t)}**

A compressed context envelope was prepared for the next agent to take over.

### What the next agent needs
- The current goal (above).
- The latest \`Research\`, \`Verification\`, and \`Build\` subfiles.
- The most recent pinned memory entries.

### What it should skip
- Anything already in the decision log.
- Original chat turns — the compressed packet supersedes them.

### Continuity check
Run \`/resume\` from the next session to bootstrap; the room state survives
across sessions, devices, and machines.`,
